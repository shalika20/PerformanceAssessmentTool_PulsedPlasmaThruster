# Performance Assessment Tool for a Pulsed Plasma Thruster
This repo contains all scripts related to GUI developed for analysis. The MATLAB based GUI helps predict the performance parameters of a PPT based on its electrical and mechanical design. Various models have been used to help with the estimation as mentioned below
1. Constant Element Model
2. Dynamical Model
3. Lumped Circuit Analysis Model
4. Plasma Flow Model
5. Electrode Erosion Model

The tool can predict the following:
1. Thrust
2. Exhaust Velocity
3. Impulse Bit
4. Specific Impulse
5. Inductance Gradient
6. Transfer Efficiency
7. Acceleration Efficiency 
8. Thruster Efficiency
9. Electrode Erosion per Discharge
10. Inductance change
